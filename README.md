CMBuilder
=========

Very basic script to simplify the creation of a new cpp project.
It is not meant to replace CMake only to provide a basic CMake setup for new projects

Directory creation with basic CMake config
* config testing using gtest
* Sources are built as lib

Usage:
------

./python3 cpp_project.py project_name

TODO:
-----

* Beautify
* add Sphinx and doxy build inside cmake
