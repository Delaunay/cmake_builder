CMBuilder
=========

Very basic script to simplify the creation of a new cpp project.
It is not meant to replace CMake only to provide a basic CMake setup for new projects
Script currently not very flexible (lot of hardcoded things)

Directory creation with basic CMake config
* config testing using gtest
* Sources are built as lib




Usage:
------



TODO:
-----

* Beautify
* add Sphinx and doxy build inside cmake
